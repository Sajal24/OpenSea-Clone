created a NFT collection and a NFT marketplace in thirdweb with Goerli testnet (sent the funds - eth and link by chainlink faucet website, that provides free funds for testnets)
Minted the NFTs in the NFT collection contract, first made in thirdweb
Listed the NFTs in the NFT marketplace contract, first made in thirdweb


Now using Replit


In app.js, importing {ChainId, ThirdwebProvider} from '@thirdweb-dev/react' - The modules needed to use thirdweb SDK and we will wrap our app with <ThirdwebProvider> </ThirdwebProvider> so that we can use thirdweb in our app,
-
Chainid for stating what network we are working on, like here Goerli


Now we have specified the network, but to get connected with the network, we need specific rpc to get connected with Goerli
-
use infura to connect to ethereum network easily, without creating our own rpc node - saving us a lot of time
